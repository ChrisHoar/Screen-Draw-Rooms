# Screen-Draw-Rooms
This project was designed to test SignalR within .Net Core. It has evolved into an application where users can collaborate on drawings via "Sketch Rooms".
# Accessing the Demo
For a live demonstration go to [chrishoar.net](https://chrishoar.net) on two different devices. 

One of those devices follow the instructions and create a "Room" and then join it. 

On the second device join the newly created room. 

When you draw on one device it will be reflected on the second.

**If you are behind a firewall you may need to get additional permissions to allow SignalR to communicate.**
